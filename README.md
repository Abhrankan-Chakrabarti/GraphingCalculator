# Graphing Calculator

This repository contains a web-based graphing calculator implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and D3.js. The calculator allows users to plot various mathematical functions in real-time and visualize them on an interactive graph.

## Features

- **Dynamic Plotting**: Enter a function and see its graph instantly updated.
- **Interactive Graph**: Zoom and pan capabilities for detailed exploration.
- **Function Support**: Includes a range of mathematical functions for plotting such as trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithmic functions (`log`, `log10`, `log2`), square root (`sqrt`), and more.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface with real-time updates.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the calculator interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for parsing user input and plotting functions.
- **D3.js**: Data-driven documents library for creating dynamic and interactive graphs.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhrankan-Chakrabarti/GraphingCalculator.git
   ```

2. Open index.html in your web browser to start using the graphing calculator.

3. Enter a mathematical function into the input field and press Plot to visualize it on the graph. Ensure to use Math. prefix for trigonometric (Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.tan), logarithmic (Math.log, Math.log10, Math.log2), and other functions (e.g., Math.sqrt, Math.pow).

4. Explore the interactive graph with zoom and pan capabilities for detailed analysis.
